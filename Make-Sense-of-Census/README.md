### Project Overview

 **Problem Statement** 

Hello!
You have been hired by 'CACT'(Census Analysis and Collection Team) to help with your numpy programming skills. Your major work for today involves census record management and data analysis.


### Learnings from the project

 - Array Appending
- Array Slicing
- Array Filtering
- Array Aggregation


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 In this project, I have learnt about subsetting array in NumPY,  many functions which reduce workload.


### Challenges faced

 I have stuck much time while finding the solution and I overcome the problem by reading from [NumPy Docs](https://numpy.org/doc)


### Additional pointers

 I have well documented the code and as well as  I have uploaded a Data file (CSV)  for reference the code and how things working in the code.
