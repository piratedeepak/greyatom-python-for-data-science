### Project Overview

 Hello lieutenant! It's with an emergency that our agency wishes to use the skills that you learned in 'python intermediate' module. Your mission if you choose to accept it, would be to help us decipher a message that we received from our intel. We have multiple text files that need to be read and have certain operations performed to get our final message.


### Learnings from the project

 - A better idea of Strings

- write and read functions on the file

- comprehensions

- loops


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 First I have extract message from files and then after combining the messages (secret) and write the secret message in a file


### Challenges faced

 - I faced problems like read, readlines, realine functions and I overcome it by reading docs on python.org
- I faced problem str and int while in printing message and then debug the code and resolve it
- I faced problem while providing variable to list type and then I check the code and try to debug it


### Additional pointers

 ### Thank you guys
